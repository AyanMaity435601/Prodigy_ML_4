# Hand Gesture Recognition

## Overview

This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using machine learning classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [LeapGestRecog dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) from Kaggle. It consists of hand gesture images categorized into various gestures such as palm, fist, thumb, etc. Each image is preprocessed by resizing and converting to grayscale.
